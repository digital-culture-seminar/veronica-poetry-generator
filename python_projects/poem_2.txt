The High Chair sits empty. 


But at the base
at the root
the soil is soiled. 

Sit down.
Stand up
What is (your) right?

Nowadays 
It’s all just take, take, take.

Take a knee. 
Take a seat
Take the stand

Who is she to say?
Who is he to judge?

In this cult of culture
I move
the aggrieved approach the bench
Better still
In this overgrown schoolyard
I motion
For a recess...

Everyone
Have several seats.
