Dark cloud
When shadows hang overhead,
Darkness falls.
A heaviness slows his breathing and his body,
And his mind screams obstructive, cynical thoughts.
Attempting to reject the fateful calls, 
He fill his head with reminders of those he holds dear.  
Sadness engulfs deep within his soul.
Latching onto him and not letting him go.
